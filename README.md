# Password Generator [![License: LGPL v3](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-LGPL_v3-orange.svg)](COPYING.LESSER)
**Password Generator** is a kind of
[digital safe](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffre-fort_num%C3%A9rique) for
passwords that doesn’t store any one. Based a master password and on savable
definitions, like domain names, lengths, etc., it generates/calculates strong
passwords through a
[cryptographic hash function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function)
(Where the reverse operation of getting input data is infeasible).

That way, this small web app allows you to have strong account securities,
different for each services, without the fear of loosing unrememberable
passwords or having them exposed when there are stolen from online databases,
like other digital safe usually have (Don’t worry, it’s not that simple). The
only thing you need to save are the definitions (In your navigator or in your
local files), that doesn’t contain any private information, and a master
password (In your brain), that doesn’t really need to be at top level security.

> Version: **-**

_For a more comfortable use, we recommend you to save every generated passwords
in your navigator, even the master one if you feel it: nowadays, navigators have
enough security to store safely your passwords. In case one is compromised, you
can still change the its definition `number` and it will be completely
different, with the same length, identity and master password (That’s another
functionality of hash functions). Moreover, navigators usually offer
synchronisation across multiple devices and platforms, which comes handy on
phones._
